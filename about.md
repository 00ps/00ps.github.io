It's not that I have much to say ...

anyway, Hi!

I'm fred, I am a sysadmin (since a few years, we're called devops)

I fall in love with [Linux](http://kernel.org) when I installed my first [RedHat](http://redhat.com) ... a little bit more than 15 years ago!

I love playing with [Ansible](http://ansible.com) and enjoy writing [Puppet](htp://puppetlabs.com) modules

You can find me on [Github](http://github.com/00ps)

Thanks for passing by.
